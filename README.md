Project #2 for Udacity's Front End Web Developer NanoDegree

--Javascript practice--

## Description
>Starting with just **HTML** and **CSS** code, writing ***JS*** from start to create a *dynamic flow* of the Loading page. Writing functions that allow multiple sections to be added and Navigation bar updating dynamically to accommodate the additions. Also changing *active status* when Navigation items are clicked or user is scrolling through page. 

## Usage
```
when navigation bar is clicked, page with smoothly scroll to section and highlight the paragraph area. If user scrolls by hand, sections will automatically highlight and un-highlight depending on if section is in Viewport or not. Adds extra flare to loading page.
```

## Acknowledgment
>Thanks **Udacity* for the challenging project that helped me get a better understanding of *JavaScript*.
